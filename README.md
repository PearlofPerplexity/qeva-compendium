Purpose:
This project is a react application containing a compendium of the fantasy world, "Qeva". It is designed to act like a wiki page and allow the user  to find different pieces of information about the world easily.

Navigation:
Ease of navigation is accomplished through various, reactive navigation components along with a search component which scans the entire website for any pages containing the keyword entered by the user. 

Most Recent Updates:
I am currently working on developing the site so that content is directly editable on each page. Most recent progress on this can be found on the basics page.
