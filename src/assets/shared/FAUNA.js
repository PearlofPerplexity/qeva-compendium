While the Caracadre have trained them as messengers and the elves learned their speech, only the Aviame have built a true relationship. The bond is so strong that flocks of bird will take direction and obey commands when called.They know the birds: their cares and worries, their coming and goings, their likes and dislikes. They know them better than even the eldar and care for them like their own. Here are a few notable birds and what is most well-know about them.`,

They are eager to obey the aviame's every command, even to their own detriment. The starlings are more often than not communal birds that fly in harmonious flocks and 
                sing to each other in
                sweet melodies. The
                most gifted aviame in
                their speech perform their
                songs in great theatres. If
                one builds a relationship with
                one starling, they often build
                one with many.`

However, unlike the eagle, its brevity in speech is not the result of weighty responsibility, but of freedom and exemption from the wheel of life. One must expect seemingly odd conversations with these birds for they share neither the common worries of birds nor people.`

They describe it as an indulgence and remain near it for as long as they can manage. Hummingbirds are skittish and do best with calm spirits and slow movements. Simply hold out a still finger to make friendship with one, but do not expect them to stay long unless you radiate goodness.`

                description: `The Caracadre order derives its name from two words, the first being the “caracara” bird. The Crested Caracara is a bird of prey; the only bird brave enough to fly over the black shores of Avlim besides the vulture. The caracadre see themselves as keeping a watchful eye over the noble races and preying on those who do evil - even in places where it is darkest. The caracadre do not look solely to the crested caracara for their name, but also for their aid. Over the years, the caracadre have trained the caracara to strike down small prey and carry written messages in their talons. One must but offer the birds a token of friendship and then set auditory markers: a marker for themselves and a marker for those they wish to find. It is an amicable relationship between the two beyond the puncture wounds the bird leaves in the cadre's arm. This being said there is healthy mutual respect as they both seem to understand each other as fierce hunters.However, to the Aviame, the caracadre have a simple relationship with the Crested Caracara: The caracadre bribe them with treats and the caracara learn their tricks. They send them as messengers and to catch small prey. In talking with the birds, it is clear that they do not mind this. Rather they find great purpose and enjoyment in it. Some are so keen to it that they will even defend a caracadre over an aviame, but not often. Speaking to the birds in their native tongue will often be enough to sway them.`

                description: `The vulture is easily the most misunderstood of them all. Their role as scavengers associates them with death and decay. However, it is this association that makes them among the most noble. Rather than causing the decay, they are the ones who stomach it. Their consumption of carcasas prevents toxins from spreading to other creatures and other people. Even the elves make this mistake, but the aviame are not quick to correct it. Vultures prefer solitude and are slow friends, but if you find a friend in a vulture, the bond will never break.`

It is a solemn and dignified creature of few words, but still communes with the Avi when the need is dire or the heavens are quiet. Some believe the eagle is a manifestation of DIA, but all eagles deny this. To build a strong relationship with these beasts, you would be wise to choose your words carefully and not test them.`

While Elves and Aviame, Caracadre commune with birds in the daytime, the Athiame are the only race to be awake at night and commune with owls - That is of course except to the dwarves who scarcely leave their mountains. The bond between owl and Athiame is strong and they know them and care for them like their own. In return, the owls care for them. Here are a few notable owls and what is most well-know about them.`,

In the lands of Orcava and the temples of the high mountains, the Asiame are removed from the politics of Avlim and did not know the hate that befell the Athiame. The snow owl is a unique link that allows them to remain connected. You see, the Athiame awake in the night and are more familiar with owls, while the Asiame live in daylight and are more familiar with birds. The snow owl is peculiar in that it spans both the night and the day as a nocturnal and diurnal creature. It hunts in the day when snow amounts and at night when it does not. The Asiame remain connected with their close relatives in this way and encourage them through messages and gifts.`

In fact, the Athiame are so eager to entice it with treats that many will approach an Athiame with that expectation. If a treat is not offered, the owl will be disappointed and fly away. If a treat is offered, the owl will share secrets and observations with the Athiame and remain nearby. If the bond is strengthened, they will even defend the them, but They will not dare to approach any being apart from the Athiame.`

They are are seen only few and far between, but they carry great wisdom if one ever earn the respect to receive its company. To those Athiame who wish their company, the wise among the Athiame suggest choosing one's words carefully and offering more questions than answers.`

Butterflies flutter around a strong presence of spirits, while gnats, locusts and centipedes swarm around reapers and wraiths. Though the secret of this connection is locked in the mind of DIA, reason would suggest that these butterflies expect something sweet to drink, while the latter expect some dead and rotten to scavenge. Insects, while many times deemed a nuisance, are the only physical creatures who are known to have a scent for the spiritual realm. The only exception to this is the hummingbird, which will smell the strong presence of a spirit.`
