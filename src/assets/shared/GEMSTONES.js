            "Moonstone or the sentience stone is that which is elemental to creating all sentient life. It brings awareness to DIA and true reality. No sentient creation evil or good survives without it and no eldar nor sentinel can create sentience without it. It can only be found on the moon of Qeva where we, the eldar, walked once and have witnessed its silver glittering glow. Some creatures have been influenced by its nightly glow upon Qeva and taken to awaken during the night and sleep during the day. The Eldar, Amare is the only known keeper of moonstone on Qeva. For each Eldar was given a sentient stone to create, but Amare did not. It is a stone of divinity as no created sentient being can reconstruct the soul.",

            "Tourmaline is the stone of immensity. At the beginning of time, DIA shattered it from his reflection, but it&#39s quality could not be contained in Qeva. It flew past the planet and ever expanded and split into planets, stars and galaxies in the outstretch of space. Everyone beyond this world and its moon is crafted from Tourmaline. So then, when one eldar reached out in divination into space, it was tourmaline that fell from the sky. You are likely familiar with its presence on the far eastern island of Arguthain where the eldar, Moriel divined a meteor from the sky and shaped it into a fortress. Do not seek out this substance, sentinel. Yes it is powerful and the source of the Dark Armies' strength who resisted us at the ends of the east, but it cannot be bottled. It continues to multiply on Arguthain and the dark armies with it. It tempts warriors far and wide, but do not be so easily tricked. It is impossible to keep in balance with the other attributes and will only be to your destruction. It is a stone of divinity as no created sentient being can experience omnipotence nor omnipresence.",
