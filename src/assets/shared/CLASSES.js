        description: `Sentinels are the guardians of Qeva and are viewed as authoritative figures in all of Avlim. To maintain this, they are the only beings formally trained by the Eldar in the arts of divination - what is commonly known as magic. Given their prestige and weight of responsibility, A novitiate cannot volunteer, but can only be selected. Before accepting this role, one should know that Sentinels have a strict moral code and life of discipline; To follow this path is to accept a difficult and restricted life, but no less rewarding. However, only races endowed with the capacity for divination are fit to serve in such a role. To initiate themselves as sentinels, a novitiate must walk to the sacred island of agate and attune themselves with one of the cardinal stones that lies there. They also select a cut of turquoise, which is crucial to the forging of the iconic luminescent blade of a Sentinel.`,
