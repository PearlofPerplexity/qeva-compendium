From obsidian, the stone of solitude HE created it for solitary was his existence and nothing else was there in all time and space. No stars brought it light, only HIS very own essence lit its shape. It was bare and perfectly smooth and yet malleable like fresh dough. HE then spun into shape a mirror of HIMSELF in the form of a fluid, translucent orb above the obsidian and the orb reflected his essence in a prism of lesser yet brilliant colors. When he saw that it was good, he allowed the swirling orb to harden and the colors became gemstones and melded into one another.  Though many colors there were, one could not decipher them from one another and light shown through the orb as clear as glass.`

His steadfastness was pronounced in stone and his invisibility in air. His attribute of immensity never in fact reached the ground, but rather flew past the planet. It continued to expand and grow and break apart into more and more planets, stars, moons, meteors and galaxies. The music of DIA was shattered into separate sounds. What was once a single song was broken into the sound of waves, wind and the chirping of birds. DIA was delighted to see his creation find life and joy in his essence, but his chief creations were still before him. DIA collected gemstones from throughout the earth to form the first sentients, but none more so than opal, that is wisdom and diamond, that is love.`

DIA pointed out to them the different plants and animals and allowed them to give names to all HIS creations. HE was pleased to see HIS creativity shine through as each creation was named. When every creature that crawled upon the land, every plant life that rooted itself in the ground and every creature that found its home on land was named, DIA turned to the waters. DIA lifted the waters from the face of the earth, creating a great cavity in the planet. The eveile walked into the cavity and named all the sea creatures swimming in the waters floating above them. When all had been named, DIA settled the waters back upon the earth. The eveile celebrated DIA's creation with a feast of every fruit in the garden, and rested with DIA in a sleep that lasted 100 years. The eveile would spend the next thousand years enjoying the bounty of Dia's creation and building great cathedrals in HIS honor. DIA even carried them into the outerworld where they walked amongst the stars, naming them all. The only place the eveile did not go was beyond the outerworld, into the void for it was covered by a veil that DIA had placed over it. He warned the eveile not to remove the veil lest they unleash a great many fell things behind it. While walking on the moons of Qeṽa, Moriel took an opportunity to slip from the surface, pure moonstone, into the sleeve of his coat. Only DIA was aware and said nothing. From this small act, the moon would be imbalanced and the waters of Qeṽa would grow restless. The coasts saw hurricanes and tsunamis and The seas became dangerous to travel and so the creatures within them became mysteries. As the coasts grew dangerous. the eveile migrated inward to the lush areas of the world; towards plants, trees and waters as God's attributes seemed to flow most prevalently through them. They learned how to care for and nurture the trees and how to harness the peace and strength of the river. They learned how to speak with the spirits and cooperate with them to divine the rarer attributes of Dia. They learned to divinely move the winds, the water and the earth. Through divination they formed great cathedrals where great masses would gather in worship and DIA was pleased.`

No weather had ever been so strong nor so fierce and wicked to the earth below it. The eveile did not know it, but It came from a great stirring in the etherworld where the spirits dwelled. Something there had been unbalanced. The eveile found shelter within their abodes, under tree and rock to hide from the distress and by the next day, the winds calmed and the skies turned blue once again. At once, the eveile came out from their hiding eerar to discover this new phenomenon. They searched the damaged lands of Avlim and found a strange figure staggering helplessly in a field. Its body luminated at first and then diminished in glow, appearing to weaken. The eveile took the figure in and nurtured it back to health; Moriel most of all for the entity favored him the most though they knew not why.. In the weeks of healing, the figure gave its name to be “Estratara” and spoke of himself as a star fallen to the ground from above, a shepherd from the unseen skies. When Moriel asked why he had fallen, Estratara pained to speak of it. He desired something ungiven to his kind; to walk in both the seen and unseen world, with one foot in each. When denied his request, Estratara took it upon himself to step into the realm of the eveile, but at great cost. The skies became angry and disturbed and DIA threw Estratara down onto the earth. And now he was banished, unable to return to the ethereal realm until the stone of celestite revealed itself to him. Moriel felt great sadness in his heart and understood not why DIA would cast him away. Following his own wisdom, Moriel pledged himself to his friend, Estratara and his quest for celestite - despite it being against the wishes of DIA. Estratara embraced Moriel and thanked him for his kindness; a caliber of which he named beyond the kindness of Dia. Moriel liked this very much.`

It could only be parsed by powers that lay behind the veil of the void. At this, Moriel was eager to learn more as to how he could help his new friend. He offered to help any way he could, even if it required parsing the very celestite chambering his soul. He only asked that his soul be returned intact for it was his greatest gift from DIA whom he still loved. Now Estratara was a 'Haela', a fallen spirit from the ethereal realm, a shepherd of the seen world and before his fall he discovered that Moriel had recovered a cut of moonstone. He coyly admitted to Moriel that their plan would work only if they had moonstone for moonstone was the stone of wisdom and required to open the veil. Moriel rejoiced and revealed it for he had given Estratara his whole trust. But Moriel was tricked and did not know that his soul and even more so the veil was a delicate thing. When Estratara called on those loyal to him in the ether, Moriel lifted the veil and they divined the celestite from the soul chamber of Moriel's body. But the deed did not go as Moriel expected. He found he could not let down the veil after he had lifted it for the void was strong. It whipped through the open seam and quickly ripped away the veil entirely. The veil was now gone and the void threatened to consume everything DIA created. To prevent this, DIA acted quickly and built gates between the layers of heaven: between the void, the everworld, the etterworld, the outerworld and the world itself. Gates so strong that the layers of heaven would not reunite until Agate above. Still, the void had been unleashed and the elements of the world would never be the same again. As a result of the evils in the ether, the skies would remain bitter and turnout harsh weather. DIA distanced himself from the eveille in the obsidian of the earth. Being HIS purest form of solitude, the earth turned rigid and unyielding to block itself from being breached. The angry seas became even more violent and unstable when they clashed against it and so weather became even more bitter. In Moriel's soul another thing changed. Without a chamber to hold it, his soul floated far from him into the ethereal layer of heavens. It created great sadness in Moriel's heart and DIA grieved with him, but could not undone such a delicate thing.`

The eveile would live longer than any of their kin and their kind would see every era to come in order that they might instruct those after them about the dangers of the void. DIA explained how they might use pain in these many years for good, but the eveile were too overcome by the news to hear it.  And so they became called the elden, for they were oldest of all sentients, last of the immortally born men and last of the invincibly born.

Estratara returned to the ether and gathered new followers, persuading them with the prowess of his new powers. When his forces in the ether became strong, he took another form in Qeṽa and began to speak into Moriel's ear. He came in a form Moriel did not recognize, in a wise form from above by the name, “Vasia”, which means “void” and advised him on how to escape his many woes. For Moriel still griefed his error in the gifting of his celestite and was desperate to remedy it and the world of Qeṽa. Vasia knew this desire and convinced Moriel that the bending of stone in a new creation may bring the resolution he sought. This idea resonated with Moriel for like a kite to a string, his soul was far from him and his heart burned for intimacy. Beyond his grief, he was dissatisfied and alone and the whisperings of Vasia consumed his mind. When his deception was accomplished, Vasia molted from this form into another and continued to take many evil and fearful shapes in Avlim. He became known as the “Great Demon” for no evil was greater nor more elusive and frightful than he. By great devilry he walked in both the seen and unseen world.`

They did not share his thirst, but pitied his restless soul and came alongside him in his plea to DIA. DIA loved the elden and answered their plea with abundance. Again HE hoped to ease Moriel's burden, though it was of his own making. DIA searched the depths of the earth and found nine pure attributes still preserved in stone. He presented one to each along with a moonstone: the stone of sentience. DIA explained to them that the moonstone was necessary to create any life. The more power drawn from the stone, the more sentience and access to wisdom a creature would have. However, the stone was limited. One moonstone could only create one sentient creation equal to their own: one male and one female. No other moonstones were there on Qeṽa than what was given to the nine eldens. Therefore, it was clear DIA intended them to create no more than one creation each. DIA warned that less of the moonstone would be a lesser awakening and more of the moonstone would awaken things undesirable; evil beyond the veil, which DIA had placed on their minds.
                To create another kind of creation, DIA commanded them to mingle the attribute with their own divinely-given image, but the purity of the gemstone they received would dominate the character of any creature they would create unless they abandoned it.`,

After the void passed through him, he was a mere rubble of matter of the elf he once was. The race of men was without a leader. Noble races fled as the wall of darkness crawled forward. After it eclipsed the largest mass of Avlim, all who survived swam to the surrounding islands. Ithmaar smirked in wrathful hate as the surface was cleared of all nobility.

After thick battle and steep loss, whisps sprang from the waters withheld and dragged away the attackers into the waves of the sea. More whisps came and flooded the area so that the bridge was dissolved. But it would not be for long. More diviners came and rose the seabed above the waves of the wisps. Again a land bridge was formed and the dwindling remnant fought on. All hope seemed lost. Tianharmve fell, followed by other great warriors. They were losing ground and Agate looked to be overcome.`

                description: `Suddenly the earth shook. Terrible tremors began to rumble the whole of Qeva. The land bridge split and attackers fell into the chasm. Shouting was heard amongst the remnant, “Retreat to Agate! Retreat!” all noble people began running to Agate as the world seemed to swallow everything behind them.As the last nobility was running to the centrance of Agate, a great rook rose from the waters, larger than any had ever seen, larger than had ever existed. His motion could be felt shaking the earth above the trembling of the earth and he sent tidal waves as his torso rotated. He reached into the ocean and pulled out the top half of agate. Once all were inside, he slammed it shut and dissolved into sand that fell to the bottom of the ocean. As the remnant was safe inside, the earth shook around them. Everything was being destroyed and renewed. The relief experience is difficult to put into words. Their bodies were sore, malnourished and their minds defeated. But the exhaustion made the relief all the more rewarding. They then fell into a deep sleep. As they did, the world had changed.`

                description: `Agate was now in the middle of a lush garden that extended for as long as they could see. Malune had also been left protected and hidden by God. While they slept, the elves of Malune gathered the stones of all the dead throughout Qeva. All the stones that had not perished corruption. They gathered them up and placed them in the garden around Agate and Dia took these stones, the souls of people passed, and formed bodies around them again. They looked as they did before, only more beautiful and without flaws and weakness. Everything that was previously invisible was now seen. The Elf, Inofain returned to sight and Majestic heavenly beings walked beside men and elves. However, they no longer looked majestic in comparison to the new bodies of the noble races. Meanwhile, the remnant awoke to light peering through the entry of agate and shimmering onto all the stones in a brilliant light. Their bodies were refreshed and new, their clothes clean and fitted. They walked out into a lush garden and ran without weariness; they laughed without worry. They met people from the past who had been dead for years, decades and ages. Obri was there, with Amare and Mhindil amongst the Aeoki slain in the third age. And a man. A man who looked strangely familiar, with a glowing presence that outshined any around him. It was Dia in his final form.`
