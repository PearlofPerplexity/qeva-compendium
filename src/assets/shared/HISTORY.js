From obsidian, the stone of solitude HE created it for solitary was his existence and nothing else was there in all time and space. No stars brought it light, only HIS very own essence lit its shape. It was bare and perfectly smooth and yet malleable like fresh dough. HE then spun into shape a mirror of HIMSELF in the form of a fluid, translucent orb above the obsidian and the orb reflected his essence in a prism of lesser yet brilliant colors. When he saw that it was good, he allowed the swirling orb to harden and the colors became gemstones and melded into one another.  Though many colors there were, one could not decipher them from one another and light shown through the orb as clear as glass.`

His steadfastness was pronounced in stone and his invisibility in air. His attribute of immensity never in fact reached the ground, but rather flew past the planet. It continued to expand and grow and break apart into more and more planets, stars, moons, meteors and galaxies. The music of DIA was shattered into separate sounds. What was once a single song was broken into the sound of waves, wind and the chirping of birds. DIA was delighted to see his creation find life and joy in his essence, but his chief creations were still before him. DIA collected gemstones from throughout the earth to form the first sentients, but none more so than opal, that is wisdom and diamond, that is love.`

DIA pointed out to them the different plants and animals and allowed them to give names to all HIS creations. HE was pleased to see HIS creativity shine through as each creation was named. When every creature that crawled upon the land, every plant life that rooted itself in the ground and every creature that found its home on land was named, DIA turned to the waters. DIA lifted the waters from the face of the earth, creating a great cavity in the planet. The eveile walked into the cavity and named all the sea creatures swimming in the waters floating above them. When all had been named, DIA settled the waters back upon the earth. The eveile celebrated DIA's creation with a feast of every fruit in the garden, and rested with DIA in a sleep that lasted 100 years. The eveile would spend the next thousand years enjoying the bounty of Dia's creation and building great cathedrals in HIS honor. DIA even carried them into the outerworld where they walked amongst the stars, naming them all. The only place the eveile did not go was beyond the outerworld, into the void for it was covered by a veil that DIA had placed over it. He warned the eveile not to remove the veil lest they unleash a great many fell things behind it. While walking on the moons of Qeṽa, Moriel took an opportunity to slip from the surface, pure moonstone, into the sleeve of his coat. Only DIA was aware and said nothing. From this small act, the moon would be imbalanced and the waters of Qeṽa would grow restless. The coasts saw hurricanes and tsunamis and The seas became dangerous to travel and so the creatures within them became mysteries. As the coasts grew dangerous. the eveile migrated inward to the lush areas of the world; towards plants, trees and waters as God's attributes seemed to flow most prevalently through them. They learned how to care for and nurture the trees and how to harness the peace and strength of the river. They learned how to speak with the spirits and cooperate with them to divine the rarer attributes of Dia. They learned to divinely move the winds, the water and the earth. Through divination they formed great cathedrals where great masses would gather in worship and DIA was pleased.`

No weather had ever been so strong nor so fierce and wicked to the earth below it. The eveile did not know it, but It came from a great stirring in the etherworld where the spirits dwelled. Something there had been unbalanced. The eveile found shelter within their abodes, under tree and rock to hide from the distress and by the next day, the winds calmed and the skies turned blue once again. At once, the eveile came out from their hiding eerar to discover this new phenomenon. They searched the damaged lands of Avlim and found a strange figure staggering helplessly in a field. Its body luminated at first and then diminished in glow, appearing to weaken. The eveile took the figure in and nurtured it back to health; Moriel most of all for the entity favored him the most though they knew not why.. In the weeks of healing, the figure gave its name to be “Estratara” and spoke of himself as a star fallen to the ground from above, a shepherd from the unseen skies. When Moriel asked why he had fallen, Estratara pained to speak of it. He desired something ungiven to his kind; to walk in both the seen and unseen world, with one foot in each. When denied his request, Estratara took it upon himself to step into the realm of the eveile, but at great cost. The skies became angry and disturbed and DIA threw Estratara down onto the earth. And now he was banished, unable to return to the ethereal realm until the stone of celestite revealed itself to him. Moriel felt great sadness in his heart and understood not why DIA would cast him away. Following his own wisdom, Moriel pledged himself to his friend, Estratara and his quest for celestite - despite it being against the wishes of DIA. Estratara embraced Moriel and thanked him for his kindness; a caliber of which he named beyond the kindness of Dia. Moriel liked this very much.`

It could only be parsed by powers that lay behind the veil of the void. At this, Moriel was eager to learn more as to how he could help his new friend. He offered to help any way he could, even if it required parsing the very celestite chambering his soul. He only asked that his soul be returned intact for it was his greatest gift from DIA whom he still loved. Now Estratara was a 'Haela', a fallen spirit from the ethereal realm, a shepherd of the seen world and before his fall he discovered that Moriel had recovered a cut of moonstone. He coyly admitted to Moriel that their plan would work only if they had moonstone for moonstone was the stone of wisdom and required to open the veil. Moriel rejoiced and revealed it for he had given Estratara his whole trust. But Moriel was tricked and did not know that his soul and even more so the veil was a delicate thing. When Estratara called on those loyal to him in the ether, Moriel lifted the veil and they divined the celestite from the soul chamber of Moriel's body. But the deed did not go as Moriel expected. He found he could not let down the veil after he had lifted it for the void was strong. It whipped through the open seam and quickly ripped away the veil entirely. The veil was now gone and the void threatened to consume everything DIA created. To prevent this, DIA acted quickly and built gates between the layers of heaven: between the void, the everworld, the etterworld, the outerworld and the world itself. Gates so strong that the layers of heaven would not reunite until Agate above. Still, the void had been unleashed and the elements of the world would never be the same again. As a result of the evils in the ether, the skies would remain bitter and turnout harsh weather. DIA distanced himself from the eveille in the obsidian of the earth. Being HIS purest form of solitude, the earth turned rigid and unyielding to block itself from being breached. The angry seas became even more violent and unstable when they clashed against it and so weather became even more bitter. In Moriel's soul another thing changed. Without a chamber to hold it, his soul floated far from him into the ethereal layer of heavens. It created great sadness in Moriel's heart and DIA grieved with him, but could not undone such a delicate thing.`

The eveile would live longer than any of their kin and their kind would see every era to come in order that they might instruct those after them about the dangers of the void. DIA explained how they might use pain in these many years for good, but the eveile were too overcome by the news to hear it.  And so they became called the elden, for they were oldest of all sentients, last of the immortally born men and last of the invincibly born.

Estratara returned to the ether and gathered new followers, persuading them with the prowess of his new powers. When his forces in the ether became strong, he took another form in Qeṽa and began to speak into Moriel's ear. He came in a form Moriel did not recognize, in a wise form from above by the name, “Vasia”, which means “void” and advised him on how to escape his many woes. For Moriel still griefed his error in the gifting of his celestite and was desperate to remedy it and the world of Qeṽa. Vasia knew this desire and convinced Moriel that the bending of stone in a new creation may bring the resolution he sought. This idea resonated with Moriel for like a kite to a string, his soul was far from him and his heart burned for intimacy. Beyond his grief, he was dissatisfied and alone and the whisperings of Vasia consumed his mind. When his deception was accomplished, Vasia molted from this form into another and continued to take many evil and fearful shapes in Avlim. He became known as the “Great Demon” for no evil was greater nor more elusive and frightful than he. By great devilry he walked in both the seen and unseen world.`

They did not share his thirst, but pitied his restless soul and came alongside him in his plea to DIA. DIA loved the elden and answered their plea with abundance. Again HE hoped to ease Moriel's burden, though it was of his own making. DIA searched the depths of the earth and found nine pure attributes still preserved in stone. He presented one to each along with a moonstone: the stone of sentience. DIA explained to them that the moonstone was necessary to create any life. The more power drawn from the stone, the more sentience and access to wisdom a creature would have. However, the stone was limited. One moonstone could only create one sentient creation equal to their own: one male and one female. No other moonstones were there on Qeṽa than what was given to the nine eldens. Therefore, it was clear DIA intended them to create no more than one creation each. DIA warned that less of the moonstone would be a lesser awakening and more of the moonstone would awaken things undesirable; evil beyond the veil, which DIA had placed on their minds.
                To create another kind of creation, DIA commanded them to mingle the attribute with their own divinely-given image, but the purity of the gemstone they received would dominate the character of any creature they would create unless they abandoned it.`,

However, Moriel's pride blinded him from seeing Dia's humbling nudge. He imagined himself as the greatest elden considering his supreme sentience and thought DIA would entrust to him with the stone of greatest responsibility. And so Moriel saw the stone of peace as a bid to bring peace to Qeṽa. With the help of the great spirit, Mentroso, Moriel twisted the crystal to his own devices. Instead of allowing the crystal to generate peace in himself and his creation, Moriel used the crystal to bring life to a creation bent on coercing peace by control. He convinced a great many heavenly host to support his path. Because Moriel had opened the stone to twist it, it became perishable. His creation would have no affinity to magic. Moriel went away to the far eastern mountains of Qeṽa where the attributes of DIA did not sprinkle and the soft doughy surface of the earth had crumbled to sand. 
                        DIA attempted to speak with him on his journey there, but Moriel would not listen nor let him speak. He was sure of his interpretation and assured DIA tha he understood. There, he formed species of evil. He formed and formed far past what DIA had intended. With each one he formed, less wisdom and love was left for each one. First he formed the hobgoblin, then the orc, then goblin and then the troll. The foulness of their nature would come to be widely known. It would come to be said that if one was misbehaving, that they were acting “orcish.” He would have abandoned the attribute of love altogether had it not been intermingled with his entire nature. In the darkness he taught them combat and grew their numbers to invade the freelands of Qeṽa. For this they would come to be called the dark armies. They reproduced for the sole purpose of warfare. Great forges spat out brutish weapons and spread ash over the canyon walls. Smoke rose up and darkened the whole land casting Qeṽa into shadow. When the remaining eveile and sentients went to commune with God, they could not find him; He was obscured by the shadow cast by Moriel. Moriel saw this as a sign from God.  It was in their vulnerability that Moriel struck. Leading a legion of evil, Moriel pillaged and burned Qeṽa's lands and whoever would not accept him as their ruler were killed.  This came to be known as the beginning of wars and separated Qeṽa into separate continents. The histories of these continents are recorded in separate accounts.`

Their forges darkened the sky and while the orcs crafted weaponry, Elves, Dwarves, Men, Aviame, Halflings, gnomes and Aeko sat alone detached from God. They were unarmed and without thought of war when the dark armies descended upon them, like animals for the slaughter. It was a halfling whose blood would be first spilt among all other nations. And at this this, the earth quaked. They ran westward until they were pressed up against the coast. Though dark skies shadowed over them, all races fell to their knees and begged Dia for salvation. It was then that an enormous splash was heard in the sea that shook the earth beneath them. Among massive waves, an island was seen in the distance. Then like gigantic arrows, sharpened columns of stone shot from the heavens. They embedded into the sea a pathway to the island. With tears, the free people funneled single file onto the pathway with the eldar elves holding the rear. At the central point of the glass-like surface of the island, Agate was a crystal stairway descending downward into a hollow cave, gleaming with gems, lit by turquoise. The eldar elves stood atop the surface to defend the island, but there was no need. The sea became tumultuous around them and engulfed any who dared to cross it. Moriel stood boldly at the beach. His legs sunk into the sand as the winds roared. To see him waiver was to see how powerful and uncrossable the path was. This event led to the fractioning of Qeṽa as it split the first blood of Dia's creation.`

At the opening of the isle rock, the noble people of Avlim came charging out with diamond sharpened swords of gem. The world had changed.`

                description: `Agate is the island formed for the noble people's protection at the beginning of wars. It became what would become known as the first of the two crystal isles. One summoned from heaven for haven and one from pride for power brought down by Moriel. On the eastern edge of the world would be the crystal isle of Arguthain and on the western edge, Agate. Arguthain would be sacred to the dark armies and Agate to the noble races. This led to sayings such as, “everything between the crystal isles” which meant everything in the world or “from Arguthain to agate” (from the east to the west). Inside of the island, Agate was a cavern of gems designed by Dia. every attribute of Dia could be found there in the hollow, turquoise-lit center of Agate, but not all could be mined. However, not just anyone could enter. It is said that DIA's rage would still manifest itself in the sea as it did at the beginning of wars if anyone attempted to enter unwelcomed. According to the caracadre, to be welcomed was to be worthy. Only oracles took passage to the Island in confidence. The waters seemed to calm unnaturally in the presence of a oracle. However, not all believed this. Some speculated that the waves and weather were over-spiritualized. But most had to admit that a divine sense surrounded the island. The great elf, Randuir, would have a vision later in the ages about the top half of Agate island resting in a lush paradise. The oracle of the time interpreted this to depict the afterlife. The caracadre were split in their thoughts about Agate. Many agreed that it was over spiritualized and never sought the stones there. They were satisfied with the human jewels that grew out from Avlim.  What need would there be of a stone of self-control when the stone of dexterity offered their true goal? However, some knew reverence was to be had for the island and the divine stones. There was some deeper need for a stone of wisdom that intelligence could not reach. These caracadre found that there were two days a year when the seas died down: the summer and autumn equinox. Only during these days, would the caracadre faithful to dia take passage to Agate. However, the island was always guarded. They spent the rest of the year crafting white boats to sail there and would burn them with their earthly possessions as soon as the journey was over. Those who attempted to take shortcuts found that their stone would quickly darken and become useless.`

Dia had shifted the fates of Avlim and saved his peoples. But too much strength did Moriel have for this to be his end. He summoned the very heights of his sorcery and every heavenly host at his disposable. He rose earth from the sea so that it crested the waters to become islands. He then reached with his power and grabbed a meteor from outside the atmosphere, throwing it onto the largest of the newly formed islands. The dark armies fled to the meteor island and Moriel peeled the exterior of the steaming meteor to form a defensible position. This saved the dark armies, but at the cost of Moriel's vitality. Moriel was succeeded by his predecessor Ithmaar, a black Athmari who had betrayed his aviame people in lust for power. Moriel remained behind the curtain, regaining his strength as he mentored Ithmaar. Ithmaar and Moriel learned that the meteor was formed by the gemstone, Tourmaline, the stone of immensity. Being the stone of immensity, it had the power to magnify or intensify any existing trait of the wearer. It in part empowered the dark armies to survive the free races of Avlim. The tourmaline mixed with other stones and minerals in the heat and magma from the meteor; it grew into large crystals. The Tourmaline would form a wall and that which grew within the walls was mined. While the dark armies were weaker than the other races by the dividing work of Moriel, they were fitted with Tourmaline armor and weapons flowing with the power of immensity. The great mining of Arguthain led to an extensive tunneling system under the island. The two Islands from west to east would come to be known as the “crystal isles.”`

Dia instructed the elves to train a select few to know the ways of divination. Only with these few would Dia speak. The Eldar would train up great warriors, disciplined and trained in divination. To the layman, they would appear as hermits or monks, but they had great power. They could command the oceans and air and move mountains. The people of Avlim would come to know them as “oracles.” They were selected from every race formed by a stone unopened and never from those who volunteered. With the training of the Eldest elves, they led the world in wisdom, divination and skill in battle. They would be as the shepherds or gardeners of the world and they would be recognized by the look of their unique blades. It was believed that one oracle from each race would be a sign of great balance in the world. Their order was trusted and each trained their own pupils, but never were the numbers many. They trained primarily in the mountain dwellings of the Aviame people as it was the closest settlement to communion with God. As mentioned earlier, a oracle's weapon was unique. Through divination, along with the handiwork of the dwarves, they crafted thin, elegant swords whose metal was infused with turquoise. Turquoise was the most conspicuous monitor of a person's bond with a stone as it naturally glowed with opal. If a oracle's blade glowed dimmed or did not glow at all, he knew along with those around him that he must reconnect to his values and to God. If he was extremely well-bonded to his stone, his blade would glow white.`

Among the most dedicated warriors were the caracadre, commonly known as adventurers. They were inspired upon seeing the building of the monuments of the Elvish cloaks and the stories of the monitoring of their borders. The Caracadre sought to be great warriors in defense of the noble people of Avlim, but they were not selected as oracles. Instead, they volunteered their lives by sacrificing their bodies to intense training and their minds to knowledge of the jewels and gems of Avlim. Few caracadre mastered more than one stone which was a feat in itself. To master one stone was to be worthy of it, bond with it, master its qualities and maintain the bond. Gems were most commonly cut from the crystal isle of Agate, while jewels grew in relative abundance. However, it is said that a hopeful Caracadre could not even step foot onto the Island unless he had humbled himself toward the task. Though the original foot pillars of Dia has eroded away, the island was traveled to via a white boat, crafted by the eldest elves. 
                Some found their stones through chance, but true humility seemed to be the key to unlock any stone. A specific stone was to be bonded with. Either set into a weapon or hung around the neck, time would be needed to show loyalty. A stone bonded by loyalty would lend itself to the wearer. However, the stone was only as powerful as the caracadre had mastered its trait. If a caracadre cut a ruby from the island of agate, he must work to master self-control in every aspect of his life. One who mastered the seven stones of life, was known as a grand caracadre. Such a master of stones was rarer than even the oracles whose greatness they rivaled, despite no affinity to divination. They were quicker and lighter than the wind wielded by the oracles and stronger than the crystals they carried. Unfortunately, Dark caracadre there were also. Instead of mastering the stones, they learned to bend the stones to their will.`

No scripts from the first elves ever spoke of this stone as being tied to any of the eldar. However, it seemed to be the trait most central to them all. If there were such a stone, A person would almost certainly become the greatest caracadre. And so there was a tale of a white stone, perfectly smooth and round. It was the shape of DIA's nature before it was shattered. Dwarves spoke about it not as myth, but as legend. If ever secured, it would be the most valuable substance on earth. Unfortunately, any attempt to excavate it seemed futile as it was brittler than thin glass. Some dwarves spoke of glass sprinkling from a perfectly round divot in their rock. Others cursed it as DIA's torment. But yet all kinds of questions around it remained: Was it real? What did it offer? Could one ever dream to hold onto it?
                There was one. After ages had past, and some tales were forgotten. An elf by the name of Mera. Mera was of the first elves and had fallen in love with the high mountains. He walked them at every sunrise and sunset. He cared for the trees there and served the creatures there. So deep in seclusion was he that he was surpassed at the pillaging of Moriel. He merely watched hills burn orange in the night from a distance. When a settlement of Dwarves passed through (for a couple centuries to dwell there), he was patient as they began to mine his sacred lands. He did not scold the dwarves, but serviced their work. The useless rubble the Dwarves had let pile in the tunnels in search for fine stones, Mera swept and cleaned. But in such dirt and scree a perfect marble of pearl would roll into his hand. He lifted it to the light of the tunnel and knew that it was valuable and fragile beyond measure. He carried the pearl in a small purse at his left hip. He felt beckoned by it to train and so he did, but never in lieu of serving the dwarves. The dwarves loved Mera for this and offered him fine gems from time to time. And so Mera eventually collected all seven of the life stones and mastered them all with ease. He would become the first grand caracadre. The next time the hills would burn in the distance would be the war of dragons and here, he would not remain idle. As he fought in battle, he fought as if he was orbiting the pearl. He moved with such delicate precision that the fragile thing would not suffer a crack after hundreds of battles. Great dragons he fought with his prized possession intact. Centuries later, his pearl would come undone from its purse. To Mera's horror, it hit the ground as he lunged upward with his sword. But to his shock, it did not break. It had hardened into something quite unbreakable. It had solidified in his character.`

                description: `Love in Beinn
                There is a great love story in the history of the Gnomes that inspired the legendary song, “Love in Beinn. It began with a young male blue gnome named Amhuinn. Amhuinn grew up around Loch Ladish in the small Gnome town of Naldia. He rather kept to himself, besides his friendship with the young green gnome lass, Ansley. There was no bit of free time that Ansley didn't use to bother Amhuinn. He would work steadily in his smithy as she would pour out every thought of her innocent soul. Amhuinn quickly became a smithy whose workmanship was sought after even by the dwarves and elves. Great smith masters visited him and sought to learn his techniques. Though he desired to stay at home in the company of Ansley and beside the peaceful waters of Loch Ladish, he rendered his knowledge and time to the races of Avlim. He spent time with the Dwarves teaching his techniques and learning far more from them than they did from him. He then took his leave to Navalil by Elvish invitation where he worked beside their great smiths to create fine Elvish weapons; some which would become legendary. He even traveled on his own volition with the dwarf, Garbhand to the land of men where they crafted great weapons and trained the smiths of men. Many years it was before Amhuinn saw his task as complete and returned to his home in Naldia. But the land he once knew was far different. It did not feel quite like home. Nobody could relate to his experiences beyond Ouri. 
                Even his childhood friend, Ansley was no longer there. Folks said that she had joined the moonstone guild and gone on her own adventures in the many lands of Qeva. She may not even be alive. Amhuinn felt depleted and lonely. He had given everything and received nothing in return. He continued to take on simple blacksmith tasks in Naldia, which had now grown into a great city. Everyday he looked into the misty Farathain Hills and felt a pull to venture there. He felt as though Dia would provide, if only he had the faith to walk into the mist. In faith, Amhuinn forged his last: a delicate silver ring set with a polished jade diamond. He crafted it to fit Ansley's finger. He wore it around his neck and took his well-loved backpack of possessions into the Farathain Hills. In the mist, he spent many years planning and building a home perfectly built for a small Gnome family. At times he wept over his project. He was designing rooms for little gnome children, when he did not even have a wife. He was an old man by the time his work was complete. He gathered up his belongings and planned to head back down the hills to Naldia. Perhaps another gnome would benefit from his workmanship one day. As Amhuinn hiked down the hills, he heard a beautiful voice echoing in the hills. He sang back to it and awaited its reply. After a short pause, it sang in return. They sang back and forth in short verses until at last Amhuinn heard only silence. He sang again, but was met once again with silence. Amhuinn was amidst lowering his head in grief when a shape appeared out of the mist on the path ahead. It was an old gnome woman. But he knew it to be Ansley. Without a second thought, he removed the ring from his neck and offered it to her. They spent their remaining days in the farathain hills sharing stories of each other's adventures in the same lands of Avlim. They were blessed with five children and each room in Amhuinn's cabin was filled. Amhuinn's children would spread the story of their parents, evoking the legend of love in Beinn; that love would be granted by Dia in the mist of Farathain hills.`

                Moriel had created creatures beyond his control and it would be his undoing. He would die by dragon fire. four dragons there were: Avaug, Veru, Nagil, and Kalsch. Veru and Kalsch were flattered by Moriel and Ithmaar and affirmed his hatred for the elder elves. But Nagil and Avaug trusted their own wisdom. They renounced evil and Flew away to find a resting place. Dragon sightings across Avlim inspired fear everywhere. No one west of Arguthain trusted the chilling shape of a dragon. When Avaug or Nagil passed overhead, or drank from a nearby river, the people hid and armed themselves. The Dragons found no kinship with any in Avlim. Time passed and Moriel considered his strength now with two dragons. He deemed a battle against the eldar elves to be a sure victory. With the orc army at his back, Ithmaar mounted Veru and made for the elf stronghold of Castiel. The Elves were defenseless and unaware. They had known safety for too long. It had been a hundred years since the beginning of wars. Because of this, the roaming guards of every great city were lazed to negligence. Avaug was also unaware, camped atop the highest peaks of the High mountains, above the smoke of Moriel. It was there that Dia spoke directly to Avaug. Dia said to Avaug, “why have you deserted my people? Avaug tensed and swiveled his head left and right, “who are you?” He snarled. 
                “I am the reason you left Moriel's side. I am the reason you breathe not only fire, but life.”
                “I have nothing to do with his filth!” Avaug shot back. “The burden of his doings do not fall upon me!” And You… You gave me life as much as the demon, Moriel! Why now would I answer to you?!
                “AVAUG. You know when wisdom is spoken. Listen when you hear it. You have confused your burdens. To go against your nature, that is your true burden. Amber and Tourmaline rule your body, do not oppose them.
                “What would you have me do?!”
                “On this mountain there are people who can guide you to your nature. You know of whom I speak. Tell them what you have seen.
                Dragon wings snapped against the cold air and Avaug surveyed the mountains for the Aviame. Through a storm of arrows, Avaug flew toward them. To their horror, his talons struck the ground like thunder and his great body was nearer and larger than any other sentient had ever witnessed. Fear of the dragon remained as Avaug spoke, but weapons were slowly sheathed and the seed of kinship was planted. The Lumion city of Navalil emptied and they marched for the stronghold of Castiel. No greater pride was ever felt by the Aviame as when they reached Castiel's gate joined by a dragon. The Lumiare sent hawks to every Avish and Elvish dwelling and their people poured in from every city. No city was not represented by at least a battalion of soldiers. At the eve of battle, the ice dragon Nagil, swooped in on Castiel's wall opposite Avaug. Though menacing in his approach, he came as an ally and bowed his head to Avaug in reverence. Not a single orc had eclipsed the horizon and every able elf and Aviame had bows drawn for battle. It is then that the War of Dragons began. It was a brutal clash of fire, ice, and metal. Both sides were captivated by a ferocity that knew no thought of failure. Such commitment to their cause led to severe losses on both sides. But in the end, good held the high ground. Ithmaar was forced to crawl back into shadow followed by what survivors there were of the orc horde. The Wind Dragon Kalsch survived and fled the battle after Veru was shot down and Ithmaar unmounted. Avaug survived, but he would never fully recover from his injuries. A wing torn by the fangs of Kalsch would prevent him from ever flying again. He would be the wisest of dragons, providing wisdom to elves, dwarves and oracles who were keen enough to find his lair.`

                year: `630 D.E.`,
                description: `The war of the weak revealed that the strategy of the dark armies had changed. They no longer struck at the heart of the enemy, but at its weakest members. It was the Aeoki in the fields of Arthadan who first noticed the smell of orcs drifting into the west. Ithmaar sent a horde of orcs under the cover of a thick haze. Aeoki were peacefully picking fruit from the trees and relaxing in the grass when they smelt them. Aeoki used their divine sense to clear the haze and shoot a turquoise flame of warning into the sky. The flame became more of a call for battle and drew armies from all kingdoms in Avlim. At the sight of it, the orcs quicken their pace. Dwarves sprang from Arfaink, Aviame trickled from the mountains and elves filtered from the forest. Men and Halflings did not answer the call. Their season of war would be later in history. The battlefield was a scattering of Aeoki. The orc's genocide of them was among the most horrifying events in the history of Avlim. The elves, Aviame and dwarves who fought there never forgot what they saw, but a bond was built that day; a lasting trust with the Aeoki. 
                Elves slid into trenches and shielded the creatures with their own bodies to take the blows. Dwarves ventured alone into swarms of orcs with nothing but their axe. It was in this battle that the eldar elf, Mhindil fell, sacrificing herself for his creation. In her last breath of divination, she spread out her fingers and pressed downward. A great many holes were pressed into the ground.  Into some orcs fell and into some Aeoki, Aviame and elves disappeared. The only nobility above ground left was herself. In a flurry of blades Mhindil slew orcs, hobgoblins and trolls with ease until at last the foe Ithmaar found his way into the hoard. Ithmaar speared the elf from the back and raised her body into the air on his sword earning the bellowing approval of the orc armies. It then rained on Arthadan fields for six days. What was once a beautiful field had become a bog, always moist with the tears of Dia. Before his death, Mhindil entrusted her species to the Aviame who carried the surviving Aeoki to the caves of Aldur. There could be no better home as the caves glittered with turquoise. However, the Aeoki never mined the turquoise out of respect for Dia. They multiplied and guarded the caves of stone with great magic. Only the Aviame were granted special permissions to mine the stone as luminescent light, which they shared with the elves. As soon as word reached Mhindil's love, Amare he sank into grief. He visited the surviving Aeoki straight away in the high mountains. Upon his arrival, one Aeoki, Macaron, scurried to Amare and clinged to his neck and shoulder. He refused to let go and would become his companion for the coming years.`

                description: `It was half an age before the elden came to know that all hope for Moriel's creation was not lost. The Eldar elves, Amare and Arboriul, were walking in the Forest of Navenia when they came upon something unfamiliar in the wood. Arboriul notched an arrow in her bow Noldir and Amare took up a dagger in his hand with the blade against his own elbow. They then proceeded to approach a cabin in the woods. Out from the entrance walked a peculiar creature holding an armload of chopped wood.  It was a humanoid, but not like he'd ever seen. Its features reminded them of an orc, but it could not be. He had the posture of a man and size of an aviame, but he was certainly neither of the two. It was the greenwood of the elves, but the creature was no elf. As Amare concentrated, she knew it to have the face of an orc. What made it so unrecognizable was its cleanliness. Unlike the typical orc, this one had clear skin and washed itself. Its expression seemed pure and its clothes modest. Not only this, it's piercings had been removed and its tattoos covered. Arboriul kept her bow drawn as she hailed the creature. At being hailed, the creature immediately dropped his load and bowed at their feet. He begged for his life. Before Amare could get a word in, the orc was admitting that he had no title to this part of the forest nor any right to live at that. He had committed many evils in his life, but now he only wished for a peaceful life. Amidst the orc's babbling, Arboriul had lowered his bow and Amare knelt beside the creature. He assisted the creature to his feet and led him inside. Over a hot tea and bread, he learned the orcs' name to be Eshiko. Eshiko explained his story in great detail to the elves. It was here that the eldar elves learned that the orc was not innately evil. He could make the choice to reject darkness, but no decision could be harder for no other race was so influenced and steeped in evil. That day Amare named the race of noble orcs, the ori. Without a race of his own, Amare had become the king of the elves, but now he felt the need to adopt the ori as his own and hopefully there would be more. He left Ishka in peace, but told him that he may call on him one day.`

Not only had he recreated the oracle's air void, but he increased its power tenfold on many dimensions. The void he surrounded himself with was void of not only air, but water and light and even hope. With the power of the immensity stone studded into his armor, he expanded the void like a giant wall that moved forward as he walked across the land. Ithmaar was few of words and said nothing to his orcs before walking westward. Orcs, trolls and goblins merely followed slowly in delighted curiosity as they watched everything the void touch sucked of water, air and life. He said only this to himself: “In this perfect year, Qeṽa shall be cleansed again.” No eldar elf nor oracle could pierce the void by divination. In boldness, Andragiol surrounded himself in love and ran into the void, but to his own demise. The darkness of the void overpowered him and Andragiol died a death that would become unspeakable among the noble races. His body was sucked of water, his lungs of air and his mind of hope. After the void passed through him, he was a mere rubble of matter of the elf he once was. The race of men was without a leader. Noble races fled as the wall of darkness crawled forward. After it eclipsed the largest mass of Avlim, all who survived swam to the surrounding islands. Ithmaar smirked in wrathful hate as the surface was cleared of all nobility. The dark races rejoiced and settled into their new kingdoms.`

Thinking of them, the Aviame oracle, Neala closed in the cave entrance so that only a hole large enough for an Aeoki remained. She spoke to them and told them they would be safe, but not to trust what would be outside their walls from here after. Hence, the Aeoki were relatively undisturbed during the age of darkness. Unfortunately, the others were not so lucky. Halflings and Gnomes were dragged from the holes and hiding. They became slaves to the orcs and suffered great oppression. The High Aviame were dispersed and moved in small groups throughout the mountains to avoid orc eyes. The worked to undermine Ithmaar by freeing those they could and watching over the Aeoki. Slaves who disobeyed orders, displeased their masters or posed a threat were taken away and abolished from existence through void magic.`

On the islands, there were no mountains high enough for the people to speak with God and no way to rise above the smoke. To remain in communion with his people, DIA spared a cut of his true essence of invisibility and bestowed it upon Avlim. To the noble races, it appeared as a star falling from the sky in the form of pure achroite, the stone of invisibility. The falling star split into two: one being the forever-after visibility of God and the second being the excess achroite not needed to clear the sky. If any would come across the excess achroite, they would have the opportunity to mask their visibility. With this event, the air that polluted the sky was cleansed. The atmosphere became clear across all of Qeṽa and the smoke of Moriel was contained to the hearts of his great forges. In the cutting of his invisibility, Dia humbled himself to take a visible form at all times. From here on, he would roam the lands possessing different people and animals. His most common and recognizable form was that of an eagle. It became known among the elden and oracles that God was always somewhere on the surface. To refuse a stranger or a request for aid, may be to refuse DIA HIMSELF. Unfortunately, this word spread and was often mishandled in lesser hands. It led to over spiritualizing events such as a bird flying overhead as well as to the idolization of animals.`

Other races began to distrust them and at times became hostile. The athiame came to be nicknamed the “Athmari” after the dark ruler, “Ithmaar”. The Athmari secluded themselves and trained in warrior's skills to protect themselves. An organization known as the “Ghost blades” was formed. The Ghost blades gained a reputation for their stealth and decisive action. Upon their return to the Athmari cliffs, the Ghost blades guarded their borders mercilessly and even their future rulers knew that they were better left alone. They were said to cut the throats of any who dared enter unwelcomed. According to myth, their blades were so quick and quiet that you would pass away like a dream.`

They had thrived and multiplied, while the other races diminished across the outer isles. Amare searched the islands for the ori (noble orc), Ishka. Together, they formed a plan to penetrate the [largest landmass] and inspire sedition from within. Knowing that Amare's presence upon the [largest land mass] would be too high profile, he enlisted a small band of halflings. They had two missions: first to warn the noble races on [the largest land mass] who had survived the void by burrowing underground. This mainly included gnomes and Aeoki joined by small communities of Aviame who found shelter in the thick walls of the mountain during the passing of the void. The second mission was the “paling of the orcs”. Essentially this meant to turn them to nobility. Ishka joined the halflings and was instrumental in the paling of many a'orc, but he was not wholly responsible. Stories would tell of the epic encounter of the halfling, Lorne. In a scuffle of orcs that scattered the party, Lorne was left alone, up against three orcs. After being disarmed, the lead orc grabbed him by the collar and prepared to stick him with his blade. However, before he could, Lorne yelled the following phrase: “The Aeoki forgive you!”  It stopped the heart of each orc there. When the lead orc looked back, the mirrored, white expression of shame on his companions caused him to drop his blade and cover his face in a fit of tears. The orcs from the surrounding battle fell like dominoes with their knees hitting the ground. The breath of evil had been taken from their lungs and they had begun to breathe nobility.`

They were deeply ashamed and repentant of the evil they had committed not only at Arthadan fields, but across their lifetime. Together, in the presence of Dia, they made a vow to surrender their entire lives to nobility. They indentured themselves to repay their debts with their own life and no other payment would suffice. This army of ori became known as “the uncorrupted” for they had been freed from the evil influence of Moriel and his fiends. The elden even wondered if this meant that the stone of peace within them had been untwisted and set right for they became extremely dedicated to their craft and focused on their mission. There would be no higher chemistry of team mentality than in the warfare of the uncorrupted. They fought not as a thousand soldiers, but as one mind. They would comprise the front lines of the noble attack upon Ithmaar's lands at the end of the age of darkness.`

It was a hard fought battle. Many died on both sides, but Amare would breach the gates of Arkris with a host of oracles, caracadre and noble warriors. There, in the center of the throne room they found Ithmaar meditating on the floor, growing a void around himself. Again it remained impenetrable and began to grow. A grand caracadre threw his sword into the void, but it seemed to disappear into the darkness. It seemed that the void was now depleted of existence itself. Ithmaar opened his eyes as it did and smiled into the terror-stricken faces of the great warriors of nobility. As it continued to grow, the noble warriors knew not what to do.

Ithmaar uttered in quiet confidence, “You stand against a darkness so dark that no light could pierce it. It is DIA's bane. You know it as well as I, he has left you alone. He does not walk beside you in the darkness. The light is what shows you that he is there and where is that light now? Well meager man, Not even Dia himself can follow where you are about to be swallowed." With that the man stepped into the void and remained there. The void did not harm him nor move him. He stood as if it strengthened him and he seemed to grow even larger. The man then blinked his eyes and his eyes were suddenly glowing white and the light pierced the unpierceable darkness. Out of the man came a booming voice, “The Lord is with them wherever they go. For I thrive in the void as much as the light. The man lifted his hands to his waist and began to grow the void himself. I ruled the void before time, before earth, before light. I was the one who cast it away into darkness and into the darkness will I soon cast you.

He moved the earth like steps in a hasty retreat to the east. The man who stood in the void, blinked and his eyes returned to their original color.

Before their guests from the west arrived, scouts watched Corsaires land on the eastern shore of orcs, hobgoblins and men.

Moriel continues to dodge and use unarmed combatives to fight Moriel until Ithmaar overreaches and Moriel grabs his arm and the sword within it. Ithmaar, now on the defense, dodged as his old master did. Upon opportunity he kicked the sword out of Moriel's hand and leapt to grab it landing away from Moriel in a summersault. They fought once again till they inner-locked and paused at the sound of an audience. Both of them look to see the noble armies looking at their civil war.

Earth sprang up from the ground and grabbed orcs into the soil. Trolls swung great Morningstars at lines of soldiers. Halflings ducked and dodge between their legs. War was everywhere. Seeing that they were unmatched, the king drew the noble armies back into full retreat, but he himself would not outlive his wounds from the battle. As the battle waned, Moriel could be seen leaping onto Ithmaar with a sword in his hand. Their duel was not over. They clashed swords and drew the attention of their armies who encircled them. Magic became to be weaponized and they surged upward shields of earth and shot thistles from weeds. Till at last, Ithmaar pushed Moriel back and began to form a void in his hand it became larger and larger threatening now to engulf a person. In a moment, Moriel collapsed Ithmaar's void in on himself and his whole being disappeared into ash apart from the hand stretching forward to create it. The amputated hand fell to the ground and Ithmaar was at last vanquished. His armies were more autonomous and volitious and did not all bow to Moriel as their leader. Hobgoblins, and orcs who did not wish to join him fled where they could and Moriel sent after them. However, it was now the dark armies who had misplaced their confidence. They thought that the Noble armies had fled to the opposite end of the earth, but they were still very close, regrouping in the haze of the Arthadain swamps. Scouts reported the overreaching arm of Moriel and the war continued. It continued for many years. With the cursed wood to the south, the battle was funneled through the Bare mountains. The noble armies established forward command posts at the Theathe cathedral and the fortress of Castiel.`

                year: `33 M.E.`,
                description: `Thus begins the story of the Athiame, Theathe. He was named by his grandmother after the forward command post of the Aviame in the war of all. His mother believed he would be a great warrior of Dia, who would reclaim the honor of the Athmari.   But his journey would find many twists before the end and his mother would die before his true destiny was realized. His mother would die in childbirth.  A motherless son, He joined the ghost blades and stayed safe behind their borders during the war of all. The athiame dealt severely with any who dared enter. They would not be party to a war where neither side respected them. Meanwhile, the oracles led the attack on The bare lands, but it was coming time to find a successor. They would meditate and reunite on what villages they should go to. As you can imagine, it was an unpopular opinion when one oracle felt called to the Ithmari cliffs.
                “You cannot go there alone, Ágalas! They will kill you!”
                “I fear Dia more than death. Have you not seen my brothers? Have you not read the holy book? It is the humblest that draws from the power of God. What greater harbor for humility could there be then than the city of a people cast into shame? Found responsible for a thousand years of suffering?”
                The rest were silent.  Agalas dawned his hood, looked over his sword, glowing furiously blue, and said, now I must go. Do not pray for me,  but for the will of Dia.
                Another oracle stood up from his chair and the chair squeaked backward. “You cannot go alone.” You have my patience” and the man ripped the stone from hi s necklace. An Elf drew his sword, embedded with a ruby. “And my self-control.” Another can forward open handed and put his arms around us to. And the strength of brotherhood. So then, four oracles set out for the Ithmari cliffs. They faced rogue rooks and whisps and clans who opposed the wars. With each they dealt with great wisdom and care. When at last they reached The Ithmari cliffs they dawned their hoods, to be recognized as the oracles of Avlim. Not long after crossing the border they were met with blades at their throats and backs in quickness and silence that even caught some of them off guard.
                “Turn back. You are not welcome here.”
                “We are messengers of Dia. If he is welcome here, we are also. 
                The ghost blades were sent into an unusual hesitation.
                 Agalas took advantage and said softly, “Lead us to the city center my friends.” And they did.
                They announced to the community that Dia had called them to this place. They believed that one of them was to become a oracle. This was an unwelcome thought. The role of the oracle already had a target in its back and how much more as an athiame? But an old woman bedridden inside had no thought of this. She was with her grandson Theathe at her bedside. She shakily placed her hand on his arm and whispered “Go.”
                Theathe went into the courtyard and to hear the words of the oracles but he said nothing. The oracles looked around and did not see the spirit of Dia resting on any of the children there. When Theathe returned to his grandmother, he found that she had passed. All of the oracles returned to the battle apart from Agalas who remained with the athiame. He lived among them and took to their customs. He meditated and worked to be an example of love that would soften the hearts of the Athiame. Theathe's grandmother passed, but her words did not. “Go” continued to ring in his hears until one day he couldn't take it. In anger, he found Agalas meditating on a rock outside the city.
                “I will go with you.”
                Agalas sighed and kept his eyes closed. “You cannot volunteer. oracles are not decided by mortals, but by Dia.”
                “Why are you still here if none of us are good enough for Dia?”
                “I wait upon Dia. He will show me at the proper time the chosen one. I will become an old man if I must wait for this child to be born.”
                “I am Theathe of Thatar. I was named for the forward command post of the aviame and I am destined to end this war.”
                Agalas opened his eyes. You have great spirit son, but you are no oracle. Perhaps, you are to fight, but do not bring your anger. It will only overtake you in the presence of tourmaline.”
                Agalas closed his eyes again and Theathe left his presence. He could not escape the repeating words of his grandmother. They echoed and shouted within. And so he left the borders of the Athmari cliffs. He traveled to the beach of Amaga, east of Agate. He stripped his clothes and dove into the waters and began to swim toward the island. The waves were fierce. He seemed opposed by the elements. Ten strokes earned him the headway of one. The currents never lessened but grew stronger. The closer he got, the more forceful they were pushing him back and forth trying to overthrow him. He dove down to the pillared steps of old and pulled himself toward the Island. He would rise to the surface for a single breath and be pushed back half the pillars he had passed at his last breath till finally he reached Agate's smooth surface. It was brutal to him. While the surface was smooth, the sides were jagged and concave. The waves would pull him away as he tried to find any kind of grip on the slick platform and then the waves would shove him into the jagged walls of the island bruising and bleeding his body. Somehow, he breached the surface. In a pressing of the waves, he pushed up with his right forearm on the smooth surface. With one arm pushing on the top and another gripping the jagged wall, he refused to let go. The wind threw his upper body around and the waters grabbed at his left leg, but he viced with the rest to stay pressed against the island. With awkward and tense movements he found himself crawling on the surface, still being tossed around by the wind. He made too much headway and was in danger of slipping off another edge of the island. After a great battling to the center, the fight was not over. The outer world thundered and shook the island. He bled from sharp crystals in the wall till at last he took the hammer from his belt and struck the crystal of faithfulness. At that, the seas calmed. He was tossed to the ground and looked up to see the gemstone on the ground before him. The elven guards were about to arrest him, but they saw that he was blessed by Dia. Theathe picked up the crystal and swam back to Amaga beach under clear skies. He returned to His people and again approached Agalas in meditation. He walked up behind him and said nothing.
                “Fish is a strange smell to experience in the Athmari cliffs,” said Agalas. He opened his eyes and turned to Theathe holding the crystal in his hand. Kneeling with both knees below Agalas. Agalas was shocked.
                “A oracle crystal... there is something special about you Theathe of Thatar. You will not be a oracle, but I will train you. Theathe joined him in meditation and learned the pathway of Dia. He was proficient with two blades, but Agalas pushed him farther.  Even Agalas grew to fear his skill with a blade. He did not know that any could oppose without the assistance of divination.`

                description: `Agalas returned to the battle to find Moriel holed up in Arguthain. The noble armies could not maintain momentum against the power of the Island. At last, Agalas and Theathe joined the head of the column, but where Agalas stopped, Theathe continued. Amongst whispers and pleas among the noble armies, he walked forward to the bridge of Moriel with two short blades drawn. (They whispered at the sighting of an Athiame and at one's boldness to step out onto the bridge to Arguthain).
                Moriel was dumbfounded when he looked out from his fortress. He thought that he was seeing the ghost of Ithmaar. He walked out onto the bridge, armies on either side.
                “Well, well. I suppose in all my wisdom, I can still be surprised.” Moriel called off his archers with a hand gesture.
                Theathe narrowed his eyes. “Your wisdom is counterfeit. Your rule is at an end.”
                “You know I once knew a young man like yourself. He ruled this world for a thousand years under my guidance. Perhaps we could make such a team.” Moriel chuckles. “But I suppose I am ahead of myself. I don't even know who you are. You could be nobody.” Moriel unties the belt holding his sword and drops it onto the bridge and continues to walk forward. “Perhaps we can get acquainted first. You seem to know my name. What is yours?”
                “Pick up your sword, fiend.”
                “Are you sure, young one? You know, your brother made quite the opposite request. He was quite wise.” 
                “We are nothing alike.”
                “Really? Are you so bold? My apprentice divined the whole world into darkness and you think you can accomplish what he could not?”
                Theathe sighs deeply and falls to his knees. “I am not. I am nobody. So should I fail, nothing will be lost.”
                “You will fail..” Moriel quickened his pace toward Theathe, divined his sword into his hand and leapt with a heavy swing. But before he can land the blow, Theathe whips into a maneuver that slices Moriel with a dozen cuts. Theathe lands in a posed, kneeled position facing away from Moriel on the other side. Furious, Moriel's colossal figure attempts another swing at Theathe, but a blow never landed on the Atriame. Twice more, Theathe avoids ever strike while returning dozens of fatal slashes quicker than lightning. All that could be heard was the slashing of steel between Moriel's plated armor as Moriel drops his blade. Bleeding out, Moriel makes one last attempt at Theathe, but not as before. He divines the sword behind Theathe. Aiming to pierce him in the back, but before he can finish the motion, He is turned to ash by a burst of flame from the dragon, Avaug. And so the prophecy was fulfilled that Moriel should die by dragon fire.`

With great effort the four sentinels pulled the remains of tourmaline under Avlim that they may be hidden and kept from further misuse. The tourmaline stones held by Akethall was taken back to the library of stones at Catedral Brielle. Orcs found ways to return to the dark hidden caverns of Akukar and the grave mountains.

While they slept, the elves of Malune gathered the stones of all the dead throughout Qeṽa. All the stones that had not perished corruption. They gathered them up and placed them in the garden around Agate and Dia took these stones, the souls of people passed, and formed bodies around them again. They looked as they did before, only more beautiful and without flaws and weakness. Everything that was previously invisible was now seen. The Elf, Inofain returned to sight and Majestic heavenly beings walked beside men and elves. However, they no longer looked majestic in comparison to the new bodies of the noble races. Meanwhile, the remnant awoke to light peering through the entry of agate and shimmering onto all the stones in a brilliant light. Their bodies were refreshed and new, their clothes clean and fitted. They walked out into a lush garden and ran without weariness; they laughed without worry. They met people from the past who had been dead for years, decades and ages. Obri was there, with Amare and Mhindil amongst the Aeoki slain in the third age. And a man. A man who looked strangely familiar, with a glowing presence that outshined any around him. It was Dia in his final form.`
