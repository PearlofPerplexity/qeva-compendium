It flew past the planet and ever expanded and split into planets, stars and galaxies in the outstretch of space. Everyone beyond this world and its moon is crafted from Tourmaline. So then, when one eldar reached out in divination into space, it was tourmaline that fell from the sky. You are likely familiar with its presence on the far eastern island of Arguthain where the eldar, Moriel divined a meteor from the sky and shaped it into a fortress. Do not seek out this substance, sentinel. Yes it is powerful and the source of the Dark Armies' strength who resisted us at the ends of the east, but it cannot be bottled. It continues to multiply on Arguthain and the dark armies with it. It tempts warriors far and wide, but do not be so easily tricked. It is impossible to keep in balance with the other attributes and will only be to your destruction. It is a stone of divinity as no created sentient being can experience omnipotence nor omnipresence.`,

To remain in communion with his people, the good and gracious DIA spared a cut of his true essence of invisibility and bestowed it upon Avlim. With this parsing of His essence, DIA would be bound to a visible form for the remainder of eternity. At its parsing, a bit of moissanite fell from the sky like a falling star. If it was not found at its fall, it will likely never be found for the stone itself is invisible.

It then hardened as volcanic glass; notably Mount Sakur in Avlim. The eldar know of this for DIA has told them, but they do not share this information with others. Rather, they allow the people of Avlim to keep their superstitions. The noble people avoid the gem, because it is black like the dark stones, which oppose DIA. The Eldar do not enlighten them because obsidian was intended by DIA to be left alone. It is a gem of solitude and if parties venture to find it, it will lose its quality or worse, be abused as it easily is. Nonetheless, still some learn the secret and venture to Sakur. DIA nor the Eldars condemn them as it is a profound blessing if used correctly. However, overall, the gem is not to be sought.

It relies on the feelings and actions of others. Aquamarine, remains at the bottom of oceans and riverbeds and the deeper one swims, the stronger the aquamrine. The river elves have the strongest of bonds and were drawn to its quality in water. It turned their eyes blue and brought them together. It remains a tradition for a river elf to dive to the bottom of a river bed and retrieve the aquamarine stone. It is the only divine stone intended to be collected and shared with DIA.
