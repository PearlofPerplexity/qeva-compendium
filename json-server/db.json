Every created thing grew from a combination of gemstones and the gemstones that remain in their original form hold great power. Each gemstone holds a unique attribute of DIA and individuals only receive the power in these gemstones if they align themselves to the stones' attribute."

A pure ethereals' sole mission is to shepherd the creation of DIA and they are ever-present in the workings of the world, sometimes taking physical form to do so.

Not only must gemstones and ethereals be present, but an individual must align themselves to both the qualities of the stone and the qualities of the ethereal in order for luminance to occur."

The more one strays from the attributes of DIA, the more they risk this transformation. However, such a transformation is not permanent. Orcs for example are merely the dark form of Ocri. A orc may then become good like any other race and no sentient creature is beyond purification. This is ture for all beings except for ethereals that is. Once an ethereal has darkened, they are too consumed by a singular nature of evil to ever return. Unlike other dark races, dark ethereals or wraiths may take a variety of monstrous."
